This is where you put your users. If you want a server on nixos, you can make a user that does not have home-manager. For you, I would use home manager, ergo you will have a user folder. I cannot explain well the use of this other than to be the part where your modules from the home directory gain their power (combine, this is like the head). Read my config or that flakes help book programmer (ryan4yin(great programmer)) if you need further understanding.
